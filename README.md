## Setup

### Bash

You must execute chmod command for permissions:
```
chmod +x hooks/install 
chmod +x hooks/verify_tests
chmod +x run
```

Install the Git hooks:
```
./hooks/install
```

### Server

You need to copy and paste the file named config.sample.py:
```
cp config/config.sample.py config/config.py
```

Update the configuration to add your database:
```
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+psycopg://youruser:yourpassword@localhost:5432/namedatabase"
```

You need to install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/active
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the backend server:
```
./run server
```

Execute the tests:
```
./run tests
```

Execute the coverage:
```
./run coverage
```
